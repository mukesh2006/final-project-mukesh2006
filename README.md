# Repository Overview

## Overview
This repository holds the code, yocto recipie for the final project. The repo holds required resources to integrate the GPIO Device Driver Kernel module into yocto build. The project aims to include a web-server to enable controlling of the LED over tcp-ip network.

### Project Goals and Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to integrate a GPIO Device Driver Kernel module into a Yocto-based build system and use it to control an LED on a Raspberry Pi. This involves building the kernel module, incorporating it into the Yocto build, and testing its functionality. Furthermore, the project seeks to expand functionality by implementing a web server, allowing remote control of the LED over a TCP/IP network. 

This project is motivated by the desire to deepen understanding of the Yocto build system, kernel module development, and networking concepts. By integrating these components, the project demonstrates how embedded systems can be enhanced with networking capabilities, providing practical insights into modern IoT applications. 

## Target Build System

Yocto build system shall be used to build for raspberry pi.

## Hardware Platform
Raspberry Pi is the target hardware platform as this has been supported [Supported Hardware](https://github.com/cu-ecen-aeld/yocto-assignments-base/wiki/Build-basic-YOCTO-image-for-RaspberryPi).

I have purchased the hardware myself.
